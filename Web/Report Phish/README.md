Seems to be a service used for reporting sites used for phishing

To check if it indeeds make some sort of http request to the site submitted I used [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)

Submitting that url I got this

Then after some minutes of waiting patiently (I didn't wait patiently I sent the request multiple times ðŸ˜‚) I got this

The flag is in the referer header
